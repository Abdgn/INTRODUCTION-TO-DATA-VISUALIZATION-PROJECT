# INTRODUCTION-TO-DATA-VISUALIZATION-PROJECT
I prepared my data using the KAGGLE website. The dataset contains earthquakes that occurred in Turkiye and its surrounding areas. This dataset only includes earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 3.5 that occurred between 1915 and February 2024. The columns are Date, time, latitude, longitude, depth, MD/ML/Mw/Ms/Mb magnitudes, location, etc.
